Website idea 1:

* User Story: As a person with a large family with lots of relatives, I would like to build a website that could serve as potentially an amateur family tree website so that I will no longer be embarrassed when I forget names of extended family members. 
* Reason: My siblings, cousins, and I are 2nd generation Asian Americans. Our parents and grandparents came to the United States as immigrants from Vietnam after the war had ended. My Grandpa/Grandma’s generation had 6 siblings, and each of them had 3-8 children (my dad has 7 siblings, and my mom has 5 siblings and 2 step siblings), and each of my aunts and uncles also had 1-3 children in the U.S. Because of this, there are always embarrassing moments where the older generation(s) have a very good memory of the family, but often times my generation will face frustration/embarrassment when conversing with our relatives. 
* Other Scenarios: I hope that perhaps this website can serve as a quick cheat sheet to figure out who they’re looking for, with the possibility to serve as a family tree for the older generation to use and add family members that I might not know about.
* Plan: I’m not sure what the home page would look like or what API’s to use or exists, however, I do know that a user profile might look something like: picture, name, their parent (with a link to that person), sibling information, birthday, and maybe some other personal information that they might like to share, or dynamically be able to include! 

Website idea 2:

* User story: as an indecisive person, I would like for a website that can help me choose a restaurant to try based on a list of places I’ve been before so that I don’t have to deal with decision paralysis. 
Reason: Lunch/Dinner can sometimes be a struggle when my significant other and I cannot decide, so this might be a good way to save some time so that we don’t spend mental capacity to think/deliberate about where to go. Believe it or not, there have been times where choosing a dinner option has taken us several hours and we will procrastinate, and regret eating so late.
Other scenarios: It can also be used to facilitate/resolve conflicts between food areas. Perhaps if multiple people are trying to figure out where to go, but everyone are strong on their opinions, this would be able to resolve that issue. The website could perhaps take it a step further where if you have been to a place recently, it may add some sort of weight so that it is less likely to be chosen, or give priority to those that have been visited at a farther date. If more than 1 person votes for the same place, it may be able to increase the likelihood of it being chosen, or simply Majority rules.
Plan: The home page might have a location to add list of restaurants to an array, and might have other parameters for things like “has been there before” or “number of people want to visit”. When the user clicks a submit button, it will choose a restaurant based on the parameters and weights OR randomize if it is a truly neutral selection.
