# Course Project Proposal

### Assignment 1 - Lesson 1
### Student: Juan Bermejo Gallego

# Travel Advisor Project

## After many hours of research, and at the same time finding something that met my expectations. The topic will be related to Travel or Travel Advisor website. Later, ideas merged easily when the theme of my project was definitely clear. However, most of the APIs available on the net seemed a bit intimidating at first glance, not all of them for sure, but, to name some of them TripAdvisor, Booking, etc. Except Kayak. So that was a good sign.

## The objective of this project is to provide users basic information about the country of destination, such as language, currency, capital city, region and population. Then the possibility of finding cheaper prices on flights in all destinations under pandemic restrictions including updates and news on this issue. 

## A brief summary of the course project, that it will consist in four pages.

## 1. The "home page" (index.html), is the store window or landing page that previsualizes the entire project, into pieces, in order to generate some kind of "craving" that influences users to visit the rest of pages of this website
## 2. The "About us" page will allow you to know what are the fundamental values ​​based on a responsible concept of traveling, in a more descriptive and interactive way.
## 3. The third page will support greater interactivity where users can learn more about countries around the world. 
## 4. The fourth and last page is the "blog". Throughout this page, travel-related topics, tips, and experience will engage users to learn more about the importance of travel in this global age.

## The APIs that will be implemented in this course project are "kayak.com" and "restcountries.eu".

## To conclude, the goal of this project is to provide knowledge, culture, and facts that help users to plan their vacations.
