# Lesson 05 - Flexbox Activity

### Required setup if not already installed (it should be)
- Install version 14 or higher of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (this is enforced by the "engines" in packages.json)

We will be building out a flexbox header component with navigation and logo/CTA buttons.

### To get started:
-   Fetch from the upstream master and merge with your local master as we start each lesson
- In your forked repo, create a new branch off of master called `lesson-05` or similar
-   Navigate to the root folder of this activity within terminal in your fork, `lesson05/activity`
-   Run `npm install`
-   Run `npx gulp`
-   Find the mockup component in the `ref` folder in several different file formats, for quick reference
-   For full mockup reference, see [Design Spec](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/84967999-db5b-4e8a-7b25-95d59dcf02d7-f2a7/) (doesn't require download/install of XD). This includes information on font and sizing.
-   Build the component shown in the mockup, matching all specifications (colors, font, sizes, etc), using Sass and HTML (in provided starter files)
-   The Logo & LogIn buttons should remain on the far left and right edges of the nav, respectively
-   The center main page buttons should stay centered within the nav
-   At screen widths less than 768px, the logo/login buttons should be on top and bottom of the main page buttons, while the page buttons remain centered between
