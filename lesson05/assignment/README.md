# Assignment 05 - CSS Grid & Flexbox

### Required setup if not already installed (it should be)
- Install version 14 or higher of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (this is enforced by the "engines" in packages.json)

Build a web page that you'd like to include in your final project that has a layout based off the provided mockup. Use CSS grid for the page layout, and flexbox where appropriate within the content areas. This page may be edited later before being added in to the final site, if this isn't a layout you'd like to keep, but for now create it using content (text, images) that you want in the final site.

[Design Spec Link](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/8117a5c5-ebde-471d-7eb0-c67b3578aeba-f726/) (doesn't require download/install of XD). Inside the lesson05/assignment/ref directory is a mockup of the layout in several different file types for quick reference.

### To get started:
-   Navigate to the root folder of this assignment within terminal in your fork, `lesson05/assignment`
-   Run `npm install`
-   Run `npx gulp`
-   Write new code in index.html and the appropriate .scss files to create a page that matches the provided layout.
-   Use CSS Grid for the overall page layout and flexbox for aligning the content within.
- 	Fill in each area's content to build a page that you plan to include in your final project. If the page will rely on API data, you can use dummy data (lorem ipsum, placeholder images) for those parts.
-   Include at least five nav items and align them as shown in mockup. If your final project won't have five pages, it's okay to use dummy data for some of the nav items.
-   Remember, when building out fluid/responsive layouts, giving components and content areas fixed heights is something to generally avoid. Let the content fill the space, and use padding/margin for whitespace.
- 	**Bonus:**  Use grid templating and try out the repeat and autofill techniques
-   Use media queries to make the layout responsive, with a design of your choosing.
