# Assignment 07 - Vue CLI

In the last assignment in lesson06, you created a responsive website with Bootstrap 4. In this assignment, you'll convert those pages and rebuild them with Vue CLI.

### To get started:
- 	Fetch from the upstream master and merge with your local master as we start each lesson
-	In your forked repo, create a new branch off of master called `lesson-07` or similar
-   Navigate to the root folder of this assignment within terminal in your fork, `lesson07/assignment`
- 	Install the Vue CLI if you haven't already with `npm install -g @vue/cli`
	- 	If installed correctly, running `vue --version` should return a number

###	Create your project using Vue CLI:

-	Follow the instructions in the Vue CLI documentation: https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html. Pass the "--no-git" flag to the create command, to prevent it from initializing the new project as a git repository (necessary because the html300 directory is a repository already, and having nested repositories leads to major problems with git).
	- Choose "default" preset, rather than choosing features manually.
	- If you're not sure whether to use npm or yarn, choose npm.

-	Once done, `cd` into the project
- 	Installing scss (in your project directory)
	-	npm command: run `npm install -D sass-loader sass`
	-	yarn command: run `yarn add sass-loader sass`
-	Installing and using Bootstrap (in your project directory)
	-	npm command: run `npm install popper.js`
	-	yarn command: run `yarn add popper.js`
	- Follow the "Getting Started" guide for Bootstrap Vue to make the package available in your project. "Using Module Bundlers" is the applicable section: https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs#using-module-bundlers.
-	You now have access to scss and all of bootstrap/bootstrap-vue. Watch the screencast for more information on using bootstrap-vue components and bootstrap features in Vue, as well as turning the bootstrap nav into an app router
-	In the project's README.md, find instructions to compile and hot reload for development. This will start the development server.


### Build out the Project

- 	Now, convert the 4 pages from lesson06 to components, then set paths in your router to those imported components. Meet the following requirements:
	-	All repeated content must be from variables in the `<script>` part of the `.vue` page, using `v-for` to iterate through and build the content
		- 	This means the content should not be hardcoded, but set in the script and populated on the page with Vue methods
	- 	You must use at least one `v-if` `v-else` statement to change content or UI.
	- 	For the image page, use a `v-for` loop to iterate through an array of images.
	- 	For the accordion page, use a `v-for` to iterate through an object to fill out the content in an accordion.
	-	Use of Vue router to navigate component pages
	- 	Don't forget to add comments to your code explaining Bootstrap 4 classes you added and your VUE code.
- 	**Bonus:**  Use VUE to change the CSS. 
- 	**Extra Bonus:**  Have an input box that changes the content as the user types. 

### To Submit:
- Create a Pull Request for your assignment branch to your forked master
- Submit the link to your pull request in your assignment submission box
- Once assignment is graded, merge the Pull Request
