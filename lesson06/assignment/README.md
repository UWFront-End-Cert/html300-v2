# Assignment 06 - Bootstrap 4

### Required setup if not already installed (it should be)
- Install version 14 or higher of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (this is enforced by the "engines" in packages.json)

We will be working with Bootstrap 4 to create a series of pages using Bootstrap components and features. You will create four pages that will contain:
- A navbar that navigates across the four pages
- Use of tooltips or popovers somewhere on one of the pages
- Page 1: A landing page with some content
- Page 2: A page with images using Bootstrap 4 responsive/fluid images
- Page 3: A page with a layout that utilizes the Bootstrap 4 grid system, make sure page components use at least 3 bootstrap sizes (XS, SM, MD, LG, XL)
- Page 4: A page that uses a Bootstrap 4 accordion component

These pages can be copied over to your final project later, so create them using the content (text, images) that you want in the final site.
