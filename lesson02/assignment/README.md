# Assignment 02 - Sass/Gulp/npm

### Required setup
- Install version 13 of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (this should be the latest version)

### To get started:
-	In your forked repo, create a new branch off of master called 'lesson-02' or similar
-   Navigate to the root folder of this assignment within terminal `lesson02/assignment/`
-   Run `npm install`
-   Run `npx gulp`
  -   Expected output from gulp is information about localhost addresses, and a browser window opening to http://localhost:3000
-   Leave gulp running. As you work with the files, browsersync will watch your scss and HTML files and reload the page in the browser on changes.
- Find the mockup of the component in the `ref` folder
- Build the component using scss, and follow the requirements found in the assignment description
- Make sure your implementation is responsive. Feel free to make changes to the design as necessary for it to look good on small screens.

### To Submit:
- Create a Pull Request for your assignment branch to your forked master
- Submit the link to your pull request in your assignment submission box
- Once assignment is graded, merge the Pull Request
